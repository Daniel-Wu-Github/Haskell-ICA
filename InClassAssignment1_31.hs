-- Step 1: Generate an Arithmetic Sequence (generateSequence)
-- look at the code in main to determine the signature, 
-- then the code to create the sequence
generateSequence :: Int -> Int -> Int -> [Int]
generateSequence start step n = take n [start, start + step ..]

-- Step 2: Filter Values Based on a Condition
-- return a list of numbers that are evenly divided by your divisor
filterDivisible :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int]
filterDivisible divisor sequence = filter (\x -> x `mod` divisor == 0) sequence

-- Step 3: Transform the Values
-- create a function to square a value, 
-- then create a function to apply
-- the function to the sequence
square :: Int -> Int
square n = n * n

transformSequence :: [Int] -> [Int]

-- Step 4: Calculate the Sum
sumTransformed :: [Int] -> Int
